<h4>THE PICTURES IN THIS BOOK</h4>

<p>were taken in Germany! That is, the pictures of
cities and churches and parks were taken there.
But Mitz and Fritz and Mr. and Mrs. Toymaker
were not.</p>

<p>These characters are played by my good actor
friends. You have seen them all on the screen. But
never before did you see:</p>

</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Those are the parts they play in this book.</p>

<p>And then, a musician friend helped me, too. What
more could one ask than to have as the music master
such a great violinist as Alexander Zukovsky?</p>

<p>I am grateful to all these kind people.</p>

<h3>"FOOLISH FRITZ"</h3>


<p>Toys! Toys! Toys! All over the room&mdash;toys!</p>

<p>It was a big, comfortable room with a
work bench in it, and shelves and a table full
of paints and pots of glue.</p>

<p>On the window seat in a corner sat a girl,
a boy, and a dog.</p>

<p>The girl wore a stiff white apron. Her
cheeks were rosy and plump. She had a
saucy look. Her big blue eyes were fixed
upon the pages of a book. She was reading
to the boy. The boy wore a green blouse
smeared with paint. He was busily carving
a wooden elephant. The dog was brown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
very long. He lay asleep beside the children
with his nose on the girl's lap.</p>

<p>These are Mitz, Fritz, and Frank. Now
you have met them. And this is their
father's workshop&mdash;the workshop of a German
toy maker in Nuremberg (N&#363;´r&#277;m-b&ucirc;rg),
city of toys.</p>

<p>Mitz was really Mitzi. Fritz was really
Frederic. Frank, the dog, was really Frankfurter.
But the former names were their
nicknames.</p>

<p>"So! It is finished at last," said the boy
who was Fritz.</p>

<p>He put the wooden elephant on the window
sill. He stretched his arms. He was
younger than his sister, and his cheeks were
not so red nor was his face so saucy. He had
the look of one who dreams&mdash;a happy look.</p>

<p>Mitzi cocked her head on one side and examined
the elephant.</p>

<p>"It is not so bad," she said. Then she
added, "For you!"</p>

<p>Fritz smiled. His face seemed made for
smiling.</p>

<p>"Now, please," he said, "read some more,
Mitz."</p>

<p>"Good. I will," answered Mitzi. "But
you must carve while I read. Father will
scold if he comes home and finds you idle."</p>

<p>Fritz began to carve a doll and Mitzi began
to read. She read about Richard Wagner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
(V&auml;g´n&#7869;r), who was one of the greatest
musicians that ever lived.</p>

<p>But suddenly she stopped reading and
screamed, "Fritz! Fritz! What are you
doing?"</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="400">
    <tr>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>Fritz looked down at his work and, behold,
he had almost cut off the head of a doll he
was carving! The poor head was hanging
by a splinter.</p>

<p>"Shame, shame! I cannot read to you if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
you do such things," said Mitzi. She started
to close the book.</p>

<p>"No, please!" begged Fritz. "I promise
I will not do it again. I was thinking only of
Richard Wagner. I was not looking at the
doll."</p>

<p>"Good, then," said Mitzi, "I shall read
more if you will not dream again."</p>

<p>But before she began to read, she got up
and went to a big cupboard. From the big
cupboard she helped herself to a lovely,
thick slice of German brown bread. Then
she took out a long knife and a long sausage,
which looked very much like the long
dog, Frank. She cut the sausage and put
pieces of it on the bread and ate it.</p>

<p>"Will you have some?" she asked Fritz.</p>

<p>But her mouth was so full of bread and
sausage that her words sounded like "Will-awamwam?"</p>

<p>Fritz shook his head. He was trying hard
to stick the doll's head back into place. Mitzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
seated herself on the window sill. She gave
a piece of meat to Frank, who gobbled it up
and promptly fell asleep again. Then she
began to read.</p>

<p>"'One day,'" she read, "'when Richard
Wagner was a little boy, he was watching
some acrobats in the market square. A band
was playing and Richard listened joyfully.
They were playing a selection which he liked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
It was "The Huntsman's Chorus." Little
Richard&mdash;' Fritz!"</p>

<p>Again Mitzi screamed and put down the
book in horror. The poor wooden doll had
fallen to the floor. The head had rolled off.
But Fritz had not noticed it at all. Fritz was
reaching for a violin, which lay on a chair
beside him. He was beginning to play the
violin.</p>

<p>"This," he said, "is 'The Huntsman's
Chorus.' It is what Richard Wagner heard
that day and loved."</p>

<p>Mitzi listened. She smiled at the pretty
music that Fritz made. She could not help
smiling.</p>

<p>Often Fritz was very stupid. Often he
made her very angry with his clumsy,
dreamy ways and the mistakes he made.
His playmates called him "Foolish Fritz."
He was forever losing things and forgetting
things and dropping things, making Mother
sigh and Father storm.</p>

<p>But his music! A different thing! Mitzi
thought it was the sweetest music in all the
world. Even Mother, who had taught him
all she knew, thought it beautiful. But
Father? Ah, Father hated it. Fritz must
never play when Father was around. Father
was very severe, and he did not love music.</p>

<p>To the strains of "The Huntsman's Chorus"
Mitzi nodded her head in time as she
chewed on her bread and sausage. Frank
awoke and gazed wonderingly at the boy
with the violin. Frank was a dachshund (d&auml;ks´ho&#861;ont)&mdash;a "badger
dog," in English.
At one time, Frank's kind of dog was used
to hunt badgers. Maybe that is why Frank
seemed interested in "The Huntsman's
Chorus."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

<p>Dachshunds are close to the ground, with
tiny, crooked legs, and bodies that look like
frankfurter sausages. Indeed, that is why
Frank's real name was Frankfurter. All at
once, the little dog's body bristled. He
pricked up his long ears and let out a terrific
bark.</p>

<p>Fritz stopped playing. Mitzi stopped eating.
They looked up and saw what Frank
had seen. The wooden elephant had disappeared
from the window sill. Outside they
heard a child crying.</p>

<p>"Give me my toy! I want my toy!" cried
the child outside.</p>

<p>Fritz climbed upon his knees and looked
out. He saw a large boy trying to take the
wooden elephant away from a small boy.
The younger child was crying and pulling at
the toy.</p>

<p>"I want it! It's mine! I took it off the
window!" he screamed.</p>

<p>But the big boy pushed so hard that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the little one fell down on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"It's mine," said the bully. "And don't
you try to get it away again or I'll push you
harder!"</p>

<p>Before Mitzi knew what had happened her
brother had darted out of the house. Now
he was standing before the big boy.</p>

<p>"Give that elephant to me," said Fritz. "It
is mine, and you stole it."</p>

<p>"It's mine now," said the boy.</p>

<p>He smiled at Fritz's angry face and soiled
workman's blouse. He stood a head taller
than Fritz.</p>

<p>"If you want it you'll have to take it away
from me," he added. He started to turn
away.</p>

<p>Fritz jumped upon him and with both fists
beat him. Fritz pounded and hit. The big
boy tried to strike back, but Fritz's arms
were moving like a windmill.</p>

<p>Mitzi stared out of the window. On her
open mouth hung neglected crumbs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
bread. Her eyes popped. Never had she
seen her "Foolish Fritz" act like this before.
He had always been so very gentle and
smiling.</p>

<p>Frank barked. The child who had been
knocked down howled. It was quite a scene.
But finally Fritz ended it all by giving the
big boy one mighty push. The bully fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
down with a heavy thud upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Fritz snatched the wooden elephant out of
the older boy's hand. He was about to go
into his house when there came a terrible
scream from the little boy.</p>

<p>"Mine! My toy! Ow!" he screamed.</p>

<p>Fritz stopped. He looked at the child, who
was very ragged and dirty and poor. The
youngster's little shoes were torn.</p>

<p>"Here. Take it," said Fritz, handing the
elephant to the youngster. "Go home, now,"
he added, "before that great clumsy one
snatches it away from you again."</p>

<p>The delighted tot ran home. The bully
limped away in the opposite direction. Fritz
rubbed his cheek where the fellow had
struck him. Then he started to go into the
house.</p>

<p>But as he turned, he almost ran into a
great burly figure, which had planted itself
in his way. It was his father!</p>

<h3>THE TOYMAKERS</h3>


<p>Mitzi sat upon a high stool in the kitchen,
nibbling a radish. Her mother was cooking.
In the workshop was Fritz being scolded by
his father.</p>

<p>Mitzi could hear the rumbling voice of the
toy maker saying, "How often must I tell
you to keep your hands off that violin in
working hours? If you had not been fiddling
today, this never would have happened!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and then
Mitzi again heard the angry voice: "See!
I take the violin away and I hide it! Now
you cannot play it ever again!"</p>

<p>Mitzi jumped down from her stool. She
nearly stepped upon Frank, who leaped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the air with his ears waving. She burst into
the workshop.</p>

<p>"Father!" she cried. "Wait, please!"</p>

<p>The toy maker was holding the violin in
his hands, and there were tears in Fritz's
eyes.</p>

<p>"I asked you to stay out of here, Mitzi,"
said the toy maker.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Father," said the little girl, "do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
not take the violin away. Let me have it.
I'll keep it. I'll never again allow him to play
it while he is working."</p>

<p>But still the toy maker held the violin.</p>

<p>Now he turned once more to Fritz and
boomed, "Do you think one makes toys to be
given away to every beggar on the streets?
Each time I go out, something happens.
Toys are ruined or given away or stolen!
And all the time you must fiddle, fiddle,
fiddle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Father, you are right," agreed
clever Mitzi. "Fritz is a stupid little donkey!
But now it is Mitz who will keep the violin.
You can trust me, Father. Come! Let me
have the violin."</p>

<p>She reached up her chubby hands, and
slowly a smile spread over the toy maker's
red face. The toy maker had a bristly mustache
that made him look like a fierce walrus.
But under all his fierceness he loved
his children.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Mitzi shall keep the
violin. But," he shook his finger at Fritz,
"if ever I find you playing upon it again
when you should be working, I shall sell it!"</p>

<p>At these words, Fritz looked as if the toy
maker had struck him. The violin had been
sent to Fritz by his mother's brother in Mittenwald,
a town of violin makers. It was the
little boy's dearest possession.</p>

<p>When their father had left the room, Fritz
said, "Oh, Mitz, you are so good!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

<p>Mitzi decided that she was hungry again,
so she began digging about in the cupboard.</p>

<p>She said, "You are a stupid little donkey!
And I am not good to you. I am not!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitz!" said her brother.</p>

<p>"No, I am never good to you," said Mitzi.
She had found a big pickle and was beginning
to gnaw at it. "And never, never will
I give you the violin. Never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitz!" said Fritz again.</p>

<p>"Never!" repeated Mitzi. Then she added
with a smile, "Unless there is no work to be
done!"</p>

<p>Fritz laughed.</p>

<p>"Come! Eat a pickle," said Mitzi.</p>

<p>They sat together, very happy, eating
pickles. Ever since Mitzi had been a small
child, she had been up to tricks and full of
fun. And always, always had she been
hungry!</p>

<p>That night when the children were in bed
the toy maker and his wife talked late into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the night. The toy maker was worried. He
was not selling his toys. Soon there would
not be money enough in the house with
which to buy food. He was telling his wife

<p>"I am tired of this life, anyway," said the
toy maker. "I want to go away from Nuremberg.
Here people buy only modern toys
that are made by machines. In big towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
people do not like the old-fashioned handmade

<p>"Where would we go?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>The toy maker replied, "We can wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
from place to place. When towns are having
fairs, all the country people come to buy.
We can go from one fair to the other, selling
our toys in the market squares."</p>

<p>"But how would we travel?" asked Mrs.
Toymaker.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Her husband raised his finger mysteriously.
"I have a secret."</p>

<p>Now, for a long time Mr. Toymaker had
been thinking of a wandering life. He was
clever with his hands and had been making
a wagon, which he planned to use as a home
for his family and himself on their wanderings.
He told his wife about it now.</p>

<p>"We shall travel through Germany like
gypsies," he said. "There is a saying that
if you cut a gypsy in ten pieces you have
not killed him. You have only made ten
gypsies. Theirs is a healthful life."</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker thought the plan a good
one. She usually agreed with her husband.
In fact, there was only one question over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
which the toy maker and his wife really disagreed.
That was the question of Fritz and
his violin. Mrs. Toymaker thought it beautiful
for people to make music. Mr. Toymaker
did not. He thought it a waste of
time.</p>

<p>He said, "One cannot touch tunes nor eat
them nor play with them as one can with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
toys. No, Fritz shall make good, solid toys
as I do, not silly, flimsy tunes, which nobody
will pay to hear."</p>

<p>But still Mrs. Toymaker did not agree.
She believed that sometimes people will pay
for things, even if they cannot touch them.
It was Mrs. Toymaker who had given Mitz
and Fritz their books about German musicians.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Toymaker who had said, "In
our Germany some of the world's greatest
composers of music were born. Many of
them played cleverly when they were little
boys. Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;my Fritz
may grow to be a great musician."</p>

<p>But she did not say this to the stubborn
toy maker.</p>

<h3>GOODBYE TO NUREMBERG</h3>


<p>The day before the toy maker and his
family were to start on their journey, Mitz
and Fritz went to the market place. They
walked through the quaint old streets of
Nuremberg where they had lived all their
lives. Frank, the dog, followed at their
heels.</p>

<p>They stood looking up at an ancient clock
on an ancient church. Under the face of the
clock sat the figure of Emperor Charles the
Fifth.</p>

<p>When the clock struck twelve, a little door
at the side opened. A row of toy knights
came marching out, followed by seven electors.
Each figure bowed stiffly to the Emperor
as it sailed past. Then it disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
into a door at the opposite side of the clock.</p>

<p>Every day this performance took place.
Every day Nuremberg children gathered
below to watch it. Fritz sighed when it was
over.</p>

<p>"That is the last time we shall see it," he
said.</p>

<p>"We shall see other things," said Mitzi.
"We are going to&mdash;to&mdash;oh, to every place
that we have read about!"</p>

<p>"We shall see the homes of great musicians,"
said Fritz, whose face was now
beaming.</p>

<p>The Germans like to remember their great
men. Even the school children are often
taken by their teachers on trips to the towns
where poets and painters and musicians
lived. It is no wonder, then, that Mitz and
Fritz were happy and excited about what
the next day was to bring.</p>

<p>As they turned to leave the market place,
Mitzi suddenly caught sight of some people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
across the street. They were walking very
slowly and gazing about with the air of seeing
things for the first time.</p>

<p>"Stay here and hold Frank," said Mitzi to
her brother. "I am going over to see those
strangers. I am going to ask to guide them
through the church."</p>

<p>She crossed the street and approached the
people. She felt certain that they must be
Americans or English, for she had watched
many like them. She decided to show how
well she could speak English.</p>

<p>"Gute day," said Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, little Gretchen!" said a jolly-looking
man.</p>

<p>"I be Mitzi," said the little girl, with a
short bow. "I will show you to the church."</p>

<p>The people laughed.</p>

<p>The jolly man said, "You wish to show us
to the church? Very well. I think the
church will be pleased to see us."</p>

<p>Mitzi took the travelers through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
church. She talked a great deal, and sometimes
they could not understand what she
said. Nevertheless when they came out
they gave her some coins. Mitzi put the
coins in her pocket and bowed again.</p>

<p>"Danke (d&auml;n´k&#7869;). Danke," she said;
which means "Thanks. Thanks."</p>

<p>The man said, "You are a good guide, and
the church seemed very glad to meet us."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Mitzi.</p>

<p>She was trying to use all the English words
she knew. Then she remembered a sentence
which an English boy had once taught her.
He had been a very naughty boy. He had
told her that it was a most polite and respectful
thing to say.</p>

<p>So the little German girl lifted her round
face to the stranger, smiled sweetly, and
said, "You&mdash;are&mdash;a&mdash;silly&mdash;goose!"</p>

<p>Mitzi could not understand why there was
a roar of laughter from her new friends.
She turned and ran across the street to
where Fritz and Frank were awaiting her.</p>

<p>"Come. We are going home to lunch
now," she said to her brother.</p>

<p>She pulled the coins out of her pocket and
showed them to Fritz. Then she pulled something
else out of her pocket and began to
eat. It was a bit of sausage.</p>

<p>They passed funny houses with pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
painted on them, and old shops full of wonderful
toys and ornaments and gingerbread.
They passed toy shops and sausage stands.
There are a thousand different kinds of sausages
in Germany.</p>

<p>Germany is the children's gingerbread
country. Think of all the childish delights
that have come out of Germany: Christmas
trees, cuckoo clocks, Hansel and Gretel,
Grimms' Fairy Tales, and the Pied Piper!</p>

<p>And toys! When a toy is marked "made
in Germany," we know that it is very fine,
because Germany is the toy center of the
world.</p>

<p>In Switzerland you would climb the Alps
and eat cheese. In Ireland you would kiss
the Blarney Stone and eat stew. In Italy you
would see the art galleries and eat spaghetti.
In China you would visit the Great Wall and
eat rice. But in Germany, especially if you
are a child, you would go to the toy shops
and eat gingerbread.</p>

<h3>BAYREUTH AND A PLAN</h3>


<p>Did you ever dream of becoming so great
that a whole town would exist in your memory?
That is what happened in the case of
Richard Wagner, the little boy who stood in
a market square and listened to "The Huntsman's
Chorus."</p>

<p>Mitz and Fritz and their parents arrived
in Bayreuth (B&#299;´roit´) in time for the Wagner
festival. People had come from all over
the world to hear the great Wagner operas.
They are performed in a beautiful theater
built especially for that purpose.</p>

<p>During the festival, the whole town talks
and thinks and remembers Richard Wagner.
In every shop window are pictures of
the composer. Even a newspaper is published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which prints only matters concerning
Richard Wagner.</p>

<p>Mitz and Fritz left their wagon home and
began to wander through the woodland
town. Fritz was so happy and excited that
one would have thought it his own festival.
He had read and heard much about Bayreuth.</p>

<p>Mitzi, too, was impressed. But this did not
stop her from nibbling at a bar of chocolate
and smearing her round face.</p>

<p>"What do all the blue and white banners
mean?" asked Fritz.</p>

<p>"They are the colors of Bavaria," said
Mitzi.</p>

<p>Just as we have our states, so has Germany
hers. In each part of the country the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
people are different from those of other
parts.</p>

<p>In the United States the southern people

the Welsh. In Switzerland the Italian-Swiss
are different from the French-Swiss.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker was a Prussian. So is the
former Kaiser, who ruled Germany before
the World War. Now the ex-Kaiser is living
quietly in Holland, and Germany is a republic
like our country.</p>

<p>But let us go back to Mitz and Fritz. It
seems that I cannot resist telling you a few
things about their country as we go along.
However, I am sure Mitz and Fritz would
not object to that. For all Germans want to
learn, even while they play.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker tried to sell his toys in the
crowded market place of Bayreuth. But he
was not very successful. People were thinking
only of the glorious music they had come
to hear.</p>

<p>Visitors wandered about the town. They
stood beside the grave of Wagner in the garden
of his home. In this grave the musician
is buried with his faithful dog.</p>

<p>It is here that we find Mitz and Fritz and
Mrs. Toymaker. Frank lay at their feet.</p>

<p>"Father is so disappointed," said Mrs.
Toymaker. "He has sold so few toys."</p>

<p>"Perhaps in the next town he will sell
more," said Fritz. Then he took his mother's
hand. "Please," he added wistfully, "tell us
something about Richard Wagner."</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker was much like Fritz and
not very much like Mr. Toymaker. Somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
she forgot her worries about not selling
toys when she thought of Wagner. So she
smiled and told the children this story:</p>

<p>"When Richard was about fourteen he
went to school in Dresden. But he soon became
very homesick for his family, who were
living in Prague (Pr&auml;k). He had no money,
so he and a schoolmate decided to walk to
Prague.</p>

<p>"It was a long distance, and the boys grew
very weary and hungry. At last Richard
made up his mind to hail the first coach and
to beg for money. The other boy was timid
and hid in the bushes.</p>

<p>"Richard stood in the center of the road
as a coach came along. He held up his hand
and the coach stopped. But the poor boy's
knees were shaking, and he could hardly
speak."</p>

<p>Mitzi interrupted her mother. "Why not?"
she asked. "I would have spoken. I would
have said, 'Give me money. I am hungry.'"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

<p>"Yes," laughed Mrs. Toymaker. "I have
no doubt of that. For you are always hungry
and you can always talk! But, you see,
Richard was different."</p>

<p>"A bit foolish, like Fritz," said Mitzi knowingly.</p>

<p>The mother paid no attention to this remark
but went on with her story: "The
people in the coach were kind and threw
money to Richard. He and his friend had a
good dinner and finally reached Prague.
But they say that he never forgot this experience."</p>

<p>A light began to shine in Mitzi's eyes as
her mother finished the tale. An idea had
been born in her busy little head. That evening
after supper she took Fritz by the hand.</p>

<p>"Come," she whispered. "I have something
to tell you&mdash;something very exciting."
She led him away from their wagon, out
upon the moonlit road. "Fritz," she said, "I
have thought of a way to help Father. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
thought of it after Mother told that story
about Richard Wagner. Now, if Richard
had been a boy musician like you, he might
have played for people and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he might have played
on his trip to Prague?" asked Fritz.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mitzi. "In every town. The
people would have thrown him so much
money that he could have bought all the
bread and sausage and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fritz laughed at Mitzi's wide eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, but what has that to do with our
helping Father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" she replied. "You shall
play on the streets, and people will throw
coins. Then, even if Father cannot sell toys,
we shall still have money with which to buy
food."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitz!" said Fritz.</p>

<p>"Oh, whist!" cried Mitzi impatiently. "I
am going to make you do it! You'll see how
easy it will be."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

<p>"But Father will not let me do it," said
Fritz. "He does not like my fiddling. He
would punish me."</p>

<p>"We won't tell him," said Mitzi. "He only
forbade you to play when he puts you to
work. Other times, it is not wrong for you
to do it. So, when Father is selling toys in
the next market place, we'll run off. You
shall play your violin, and pretty soon crowds
of people will gather and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mi&mdash;" began Fritz.</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddlesticks!" snapped Mitzi. She
took him firmly by the arm. "Come," she
said. "It is all settled. It is a fine plan. So
now let us find something to eat and then
go to bed."</p>

<h3>ALONG THE ROAD</h3>


<p>Mr. Toymaker heard of a fair to be held
in Mainz (M&#299;nts). So he decided to go there
at once, although it was some distance from
Bayreuth.</p>

<p>On the journey the children were kept
busy. Fritz had to help his father with
many things. Mitzi had to help her mother.
They found no time to try their plan. But
they did not forget it.</p>

<p>Along the road they saw much of interest.
They passed small hotels for young travelers
hiking about the country. In different lands
there are different sports. Spain has her
bullfights. England has her cricket. Switzerland's
high mountains are popular for
snow and ice sports. The United States
plays baseball. But Germany hikes.</p>

<p>All over the land, in the summer time and
even in winter, one meets groups of walkers.
Children walk with teachers. Older children
walk alone. As they walk they sing. They
admire their country and learn. They stop
overnight in these little youth inns&mdash;hotels
made especially for boys and girls.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

<p>"Some day I am going with a group," said
Mitzi. "I am going on hiking trips."</p>

<p>"Not until you are a bachfisch (b&auml;k´fish),"
said Fritz.</p>

<p>In Germany a young girl is called a "bachfisch,"
which means "baked fish."</p>

<p>But not so long ago in Germany girls did
not hike and swim and play tennis. But now
it is different. Girls are interested in everything,
just as they are in America.</p>

<p>The Toymaker family journeyed through
Hanau (H&auml;´nou), home of the Grimm brothers.
The children spoke of these two devoted
men, who had always worked together.
Some of their stories have become famous,
as, for instance, "Hansel and Gretel" and
"Tom Thumb."</p>

<p>The family moved on toward Frankfurt.</p>

<p>The five Rothschild brothers had lived in
Frankfurt. They had become the richest
men in Europe and were called "The Five
Frankfurters." Mrs. Toymaker remembered
that the great poet, Goethe, had been
born there.</p>

<h3>MAINZ AND A BEGGAR</h3>


<p>"Come quickly, Fritz. Now, we can slip
away!" said Mitzi.</p>

<p>They were in the market place of Mainz.
Their father was sitting at a booth under a
striped umbrella. He was selling a few toys,
and he looked more cheerful than usual.</p>

<p>Mitzi led her brother down the street.</p>

<p>"Quickly, come! We shall stand here before
this big church," she said.</p>

<p>They had stopped in front of a beautiful
old cathedral. Near by stood the statue of a
man holding a sheet of paper in his hands.</p>

<p>"That is the statue of Gutenberg (Go&#862;o´t&#277;n-b&#277;rk),
the inventor of printing," said
Mitzi.</p>

<p>Fritz could not help thinking, just then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of all the great men who have come out of
Germany. There was this Gutenberg, born
here in Mainz. There was Professor Einstein
(&#298;n´st&#299;n), the famous scientist, born in
Ulm. There was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fritz! Fritz!" His sister was stamping
her foot and screaming until she was almost
purple in the face. "Will you listen?" she
cried. "What are you thinking of? Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
now! Stop dreaming and play your violin!"</p>

<p>Fritz had to laugh at her stern round face
and her sharp command.</p>

<p>He saluted and said, "Yes, yes, General!
I obey."</p>

<p>Then he took up his violin and began to
play. Several people stopped to listen. They
smiled but passed on. Mitzi stood on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
foot and then on the other. Frank lay at her
feet, wondering why they did not go on to
explore this strange new city. Fritz played
and Mitz stood, and only a few people seemed
to notice them. Among these was a gentleman
who put his hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Catch!" he said to Mitzi, as he threw her
a coin.</p>

<p>After some time, Fritz grew tired and
Mitzi discouraged.</p>

<p>"Let us go and buy sausage with this
coin," said Mitzi.</p>

<p>She was not altogether pleased with the
way things had worked out. But, anyway,
she wanted to surprise her father with the
small bit they had been able to make.</p>

<p>They turned to leave, when all at once they
heard a whining sound behind them. They
looked around. Sitting upon the church
steps was a beggar. He wore ragged clothes
and was a very old man. He held out his
hand to Mitz and Fritz.</p>

<p>He said, "I am a beggar and I am hungry.
Will you give me your coin?"</p>

<p>He looked miserable. Mitzi felt sorry for
him. But still
she thought of
her father's
pleasure if she
should return
home with sausages.</p>

<p>She thought
how she would
say to her
father, "It was
Fritz's music
that did it."</p>

<p>But Fritz
was tugging
at her sleeve.</p>

<p>"Give it to
him," said the boy. "See! He is very old."</p>

<p>Mitzi put her hand into the pocket of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
little apron and pulled out the precious coin.
She looked at it lovingly, then she threw it to
the old man.</p>

<p>"Come along, Fritz," she said.</p>

<p>The children turned away and left a happy
beggar behind.</p>

<h3>DOWN THE RHINE AND TROUBLES</h3>


<p>Mr. Toymaker felt almost jolly. He
counted the money he had made and
chuckled.</p>

<p>"At last our luck has changed," he said.
"I have really sold some toys. Now, let us
go on. Let us wander down the Rhine and
stop at friendly fairs along the way."</p>

<p>Mitzi was not so pleased with her day.</p>

<p>"Still we shall not give up," she said to
Fritz. "At the next large town you must
give another concert. Only we shall take
care this time that there are no beggars
about!"</p>

<p>The family left Mainz and started along
the shore of the most famous river in all the
world. England has her river Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
(T&#277;mz). France is proud of the Seine (S&#257;n).
Italy loves the Tiber. Russia sings of the
Volga. In Austria it is the Danube. But the
River Rhine is dear to Germany.</p>

<p>Castles on every hill have ancient legends.
The Toymaker family gazed upon beautiful,
vine-covered hillsides and villages where
people live by the making of wine. The
Rhine land is a wine land. Some of the best
wines in the world come from here.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

<p>Mitz and Fritz thought of the stories of
Siegfried (S&#275;g´fr&#275;d), that great hero of
Wagner's operas, "Siegfried" and "The Twilight
of the Gods." In the Rhine land Siegfried
was born.</p>

<p>They thought of Charlemagne (Sh&auml;r´le&#772;&#781;-m&#257;n),
that mighty conqueror, who lies sleeping
in this land. They thought of dragons,
of buried treasure, of brave heroes, of secret
caves. The Rhine country is full of such
thoughts.</p>

<p>Then they came to Bingen (B&#301;n&#7713;´&#277;n).</p>

<p>"The Mouse Tower!" cried Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Tell us the story, please, Mother!" said
Fritz.</p>

<p>The children had heard this tale many
times. But never before had they heard it
told while they were looking at the old tower.
It stood in the center of the river.</p>

<p>"Long ago," began Mrs. Toymaker, "there
lived a cruel bishop. When the poor people
were starving, he bought all the grain in the land.</p>

<p>He locked it up in his barn. The hungry
villagers came to steal the grain. While
they were in the barn, the bishop set fire
to it.</p>

<p>"He said, 'These people deserve to die.
They are like mice stealing from a granary.'</p>

<p>"But soon he was punished for his wickedness.
One day thousands of mice broke into
his tower and ate him up. That is why this
is called the Mouse Tower."</p>

<p>Said Fritz, "He deserved to be eaten!"</p>

<p>Said Mitz, "I wonder how a bishop would
taste to a rat."</p>

<p>"Mitz! Mitz!" laughed Mrs. Toymaker.
"What strange ideas you have!"</p>

<p>Yet Mrs. Toymaker could hardly guess
what strange things Mitzi was really going
to do. Even Fritz did not know. Indeed,
Mitzi herself was unaware of all that lay before
her.</p>

<p>The Toymakers traveled along the Rhine.</p>

  </div>

<p>They passed the beautiful rock of the Lorelei
and Mrs. Toymaker told Mitz and Fritz
the famous legend of the beautiful maiden
who sat upon the rock combing her golden
hair. She sang
and called to
passing ships,
and her voice
was so beautiful
that fishermen
and sailors
tried to reach
the rock but
they were always
dashed to
pieces on the
reefs at the foot
of the cliffs.</p>


<p>Mitz and
Fritz loved
this story.</p>

<p>The Toymakers stopped at one or two
small towns. But Mr. Toymaker sold no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
toys. Again he grew worried. They passed
happy people bathing in the river. Gay bath-houses
dot the shores. Bathers bake themselves
in the sun and rest beside the river.</p>

<p>"There is never any rest for me," sighed
poor Mr. Toymaker.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, when we reach Coblenz (k&#333;´bl&#277;nts),
you will sell more toys," said his
wife.</p>

<p>"When we reach Coblenz," murmured
Mitzi to Fritz, "you are to give another concert."</p>

<p>When they arrived in Coblenz, Mitzi said,
"Come along, now, Fritz. This is our
chance."</p>

<p>A short time later, Mr. Toymaker looked
about and could not find Fritz and Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Where are the children?" he asked.
"They are always running off."</p>

<p>"They have gone to the town," answered
Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>"I did not tell them they could go," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Mr. Toymaker. "What are they up to? They
should stay and help me with my work."</p>

<p>"But they finished their work," said Mrs.
Toymaker.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker grunted. He would surely
have grunted more angrily had he seen what
his children were doing at that moment.
Fritz was standing in a far corner of the
market square, playing his violin. Mitzi was
standing by his side.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>

<p>Coblenz is a city of manufacturing and
similar industries. The fortress across the
river was occupied by American soldiers
after the World War. Sometimes in a quiet
city people are not much hurried. Therefore
they give heed to pleasant sounds. Coblenz
has been a quiet city since the soldiers left.</p>

<p>Mitzi eagerly watched the passers-by.
She smiled as Fritz played. The little dog
Frank wagged his tail happily. Then he fell
asleep on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Soon a large number of people gathered.
They stood listening.</p>

<p>One said to another, "The boy plays well.
He is a real musician."</p>

<p>Several coins were thrown.</p>

<p>"I am right!" thought Mitzi. Her heart
pounded with delight. "People will pay to
hear my Fritz's music. They will!"</p>

<p>When the day was almost done, Fritz
stopped playing. Mitzi showed him the
money they had made.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

<p>"See," she said. "Enough coins to make
even Father smile! Come. Let us give them
to Father. How pleased he will be!"</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, he will like my playing,"
said Fritz.</p>

<p>They hurried toward their wagon, where
they found Mr. Toymaker very much annoyed.</p>

<p>"Why did you run away and not tell me
where you were going?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mitzi held out the money.</p>

<p>"See, Father," she said. "See what Fritz's
music has brought!"</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker looked at the coins in
Mitzi's hand. Then he looked at the happy
face of the little girl. And then he turned
to Fritz, who was smiling at him.</p>

<p>"You are a very naughty boy!" he said.</p>

<p>The smile left Fritz's face. Mitzi caught
her father's arm.</p>

<p>"But, Father," she said. "You don't
understand. Fritz did nothing wrong. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
only played his violin when he had finished
the work you gave him. He played in the
town, and people threw coins because they
liked his music."</p>

never steal, and neither would I!"</p>

Mr. Toymaker. "You cannot make me believe

up to it. They must be made to obey! Tonight
they shall go to bed without any
supper."</p>

<p>Fritz cried himself to sleep that night.
Mitzi tried to comfort him. To be accused
of stealing! That was worse than having
to go to bed without supper.</p>

<p>"We'll show Father, Fritz," Mitzi said
bravely. "You'll see."</p>

<p>Still her heart was heavy.</p>

"If only he would let me play for him! And
now he thinks that I am a thief!"</p>

<p>They had arrived near the town of Bonn (Bo&#772;&#781;n) on
the Rhine. In the distance they
could see the buildings of a large university.</p>

<p>Fritz had not smiled since their terrible
experience in Coblenz. Now, however, Mitzi
hoped to cheer him.</p>

<p>"See, Fritz," she said. "We are in the
town of Beethoven (B&#257;´t&#333;-v&#277;n)."</p>

<p>At the sound of this name Fritz's eyes
brightened. Beethoven was one of the greatest
musicians that ever lived.</p>

born. Come, Fritz."</p>

<p>The boy and girl started off together for
the pretty little village.</p>

<p>Later, Mr. and Mrs. Toymaker set off for
the market place to sell their wares.</p>

<p>"I do wish you would listen to Fritz's
playing," said Mrs. Toymaker, as they
walked along. "He has been so unhappy
since that day you scolded him. Perhaps,
after all, our son may be a real musician."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

<p>"Say no more about that," growled Mr.
Toymaker. "I'll have no idle musicians in
my family. Look at all the starving tune
makers in the world! They cannot even support
themselves. No! Music is foolish!"</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Toymaker, "you forget
that Beethoven&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was different!" snapped Mr. Toymaker.
"We cannot all be geniuses!"</p>

<p>So what could poor Mrs. Toymaker say?
Often the good lady had wondered why it
was that her husband wanted Fritz to make
toys. Surely the making of toys had not
proved a happy trade for Mr. Toymaker!
But it was very difficult to argue with him,
so his wife did not try.</p>

<p>The children visited Beethoven's house.
It is now a museum. In it are such relics as
the musician's letters, his piano, and even
his ear trumpets. For Beethoven became
deaf. Imagine such a thing as a deaf composer!
Yet this wonderful man composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
some of his most beautiful music even after
he could not hear.</p>

<p>"I have read many things about Beethoven,"
said Fritz to Mitzi. "But the part I like
to read about is when he was a boy."</p>

<p>Then Fritz told his sister some of the
things he had read: "One night when Ludwig
was asleep, his father came home and
woke him up. He stood at this very gate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
called, 'Up, up, Ludwig, and play!' His
father kept him at the piano all night long.
Next day Ludwig was so tired that he could
not keep awake at school."</p>

<p>"Why did his father do that?" asked Mitzi
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Fritz, "he wanted
Ludwig to be a great pianist and give concerts."</p>

<p>There is a statue of Beethoven in the main
square of Bonn. In Germany a statue is
called a "denkmal," which means a "think
over." As Mitz and Fritz looked upon this
"think over," they thought over many
things.</p>

<p>"It seems strange," sighed Mitzi, "that
Ludwig's father forced him to play, while
your father forbids you to."</p>

<p>Fritz laughed.</p>

<p>"You silly!" he said. "I am not Ludwig
van Beethoven."</p>

<p>Mitzi began to look like a fierce young lion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
She really could look that way sometimes.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "but you are Fritz! And
you can play the violin more beautifully than
any other boy in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitz, what are you saying?" laughed
her brother.</p>

<p>But Mitzi was firm.</p>

<p>"One day we shall see," she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker sold enough toys that day
to buy dinner. Next day the family started
off again along the Rhine.</p>

<p>Then, after many long days of traveling,
the Toymakers at last reached the town of
Hamelin. This is the scene of the Pied Piper
tale. It is where something remarkable is
supposed to have happened to children years
and years ago. Hamelin is also the place

<h3>MITZI IN HAMELIN</h3>


<p>Mitz was not Mitz today. She was the Pied
Piper of Hamelin! She had started off for
a walk through the town. With her was
Frank, the long dog, and an equally long
sausage. She had asked her mother's permission
to go.</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker had said, "Yes, you may
go. But be sure to come home early."</p>

<p>Fritz stayed with his father, helping him
to paint some toys and to repair others.
They were getting ready for a fair in Hanover,
a city not far away.</p>

<p>So Mitzi wandered off alone&mdash;Mitz,
Frank, and the sausage! They passed
through an old gateway into Hamelin. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a storybook town it was! Every crooked
house, every narrow street reminded Mitzi
of the Pied Piper
legend.</p>

<p>She could almost see the funny, tall man playing on his pipes.
She could imagine the rats scampering after him. She could hear
the voices of the children as they followed his music. For, when
the Piper had charmed the terrible rats out of Hamelin,
the people refused to pay him what they had
promised. So the tall stranger piped the
children away, in order to punish the ungrateful
villagers.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

<p>Robert Browning has written a poem
about it.</p>

<p>Hamelin is a quiet little town. Mitzi came
upon an old fountain named after the rat
catcher. She saw an inn called the Rat Jug.
Altogether it was too magical and story-like
to be true. So Mitzi became the Pied Piper.</p>

<p>She began to lift her feet up high. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
straightened out her plump little shoulders.
Then she raised the sausage to her lips. But
she did not eat it. The sausage became her
pipe. Marching along with Frank at her
heels, she piped upon her sausage and lived
the old story. A few people looked at her
and smiled.</p>

<p>Through a narrow lane she went. It was
the same lane through which the Piper had
led the children. Even today it is unlawful
to play a pipe in this lane. But Mitzi's pipe
could only be heard by Mitzi herself. She
followed the pathway out of town and upon
a country road.</p>

<p>The lines of the poem came to her mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after him the children pressed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She led her make-believe children up the
mountain side&mdash;a long line of children, but
really, only a long dog! They reached a
cave in the hillside. The sun beat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
upon them and the little dog's tongue swept
the ground. This was not strange, since
Frank was so close to the ground, anyway.</p>

   <img style="float:right;" src="./images/illus086.jpg" width="300"
   border="0" alt="BEGAN TO EAT HER PIPE"></img></span>
  </div>

<p>Mitzi sat down
upon a rock and began
to eat her pipe.
She was still in a
land of other things.
She could still see
the mass of children
flocking after the
sweet music. She
could hear their laughter as they tumbled
into the cave.</p>

<p>And then it happened! Real music! It
was coming closer. A tall figure appeared
over the hill.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His queer long coat from heel to head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was half of yellow and half of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself was tall and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

<p>He stood before Mitzi and stopped playing
on his pipe.</p>

<p>He said, "Why are you not in the cave,
Mitzi? Go into the cave with the other
children."</p>

<p>"I must go home to Mother and Father
and Fritz," said Mitzi. "It grows late. See!
The sun is sinking."</p>

<p>Indeed, it had become darker, and there
was a chill in the air.</p>

<p>"Go into the cave, Mitzi," repeated the tall
stranger quietly.</p>

<p>Then he began to play the sweetest music
that Mitzi had ever heard. He walked into
the cave, prancing as he walked. Mitzi got
up. She wanted to run home, but she could
not. She could only follow the Piper into
the cave.</p>

<p>Now, at the toy maker's wagon the family
began to worry. It was almost dark, and
Mitzi had not come home.</p>

<p>"I will go and find her," said Fritz.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker decided to go along with
Fritz.</p>

  </table>

<p>Meanwhile, Mitzi was inside the cave.
There she sat with many wide-eyed children.
She wanted to go home. But the Piper was
playing and making her happy. She felt all
snuggly and contented.</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of Fritz. Oh, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
must go! She and Fritz had much to do.
She could not stay here any longer. In the
morning they were going to leave Hamelin.
If she did not return to the wagon, they
would go on without her.</p>

<p>"Let me out! Let me out!" cried Mitzi.
"I must go to Fritz. Let me out!"</p>

<p>The Piper tried to hold her. She struggled.
She kicked. She screamed.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop! You are hurting me," said
the Piper.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

<p>"I mean to hurt you!" she cried. "I want
to go. I want Fritz."</p>

<p>"Then wake up, you silly," said the Piper.
"For I am Fritz!"</p>

<p>She stopped kicking and looked. Yes, the
Piper had the face of Fritz. He was Fritz!
She rubbed her eyes. How could Fritz be a
Pied Piper? Where did he get the cloak?
She rubbed her eyes again. This time, when
she looked, the Piper was not there any
more, but only Fritz and her mother, laughing
at her.</p>

<p>"Come home, you little sleepyhead," said
Mrs. Toymaker, putting her arm about her
little daughter.</p>

<p>On the way home Mitzi could not speak.
And when Mitzi could not speak, there was
something quite wrong or strange or exciting.
This time it was something exciting.
For her dream had given her a wonderful
idea.</p>

<h3>STR&Ouml;BECK AND DISGRACE</h3>


<p>The family were wandering through the
Harz (H&auml;rts) Mountains. Mitz and Fritz
had never before seen so many trees nor
heard such lovely bird songs. Mrs. Toymaker
told them about the famous canary
birds raised in the Harz Mountains.</p>

<p>"They are considered the finest singers in
the world," she said.</p>

<p>The children loved to pass through tiny
villages and see the quaint costumes of the
peasants. In large cities the people do not
wear costumes. But in mountain hamlets
they often wear the dress of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Mitzi was much interested in costumes
just now. For Mitzi was making one. She
had decided to dress her brother as the Pied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>

Piper. She was collecting every bit of red
and yellow goods she could find. She was
sewing, sewing, sewing as they drove along.
Some of her red scraps were pink, it must
be admitted. Some of her yellow scraps
were white. But this did not bother Mitzi.</p>

<p>She was making a Pied Piper cloak for
Fritz. She picked up bits of cloth along the
way and washed them carefully. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
begged and obtained all the rags her mother
had. At the tiny windows of their wagon
hung yellow curtains. Mitzi longed to use
them for her precious cloak.</p>

<p>But when she asked for them, Mrs. Toymaker
said, "If you will not tell me what you
are doing, surely I cannot let you have
them."</p>

<p>But Mitzi would not tell. It was to be a
secret between Fritz and herself. When
they reached the next large town, Fritz was
to put on the cloak. He was to play his violin
dressed as the Pied Piper. Mitzi planned
to bring Mr. Toymaker to the scene of the
concert. She hoped to show him at last that
Fritz's music could please people and make
them throw money.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker was silent and sad. He
wondered what would happen to them all if
his business did not improve. A gypsy life
was not very pleasant, after all. A cosy
home was better for a German family.</p>

<p>In September there was to be an important
fair in the city of Leipzig (L&#299;p´s&#301;k).
Mr. Toymaker determined to be there. But
until then they would be obliged to wander.</p>

<p>One day they approached the town of
Str&ouml;beck.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Toymaker, "we are in time
for the great chess festival. People who are
interested in chess come to this festival from
far and near. Let us stop."</p>

<p>Mitzi, who was busily sewing, looked up.</p>

<p>"What is chess?" she asked. "Is it like
cheese? Is it good to eat?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker laughed, "No, no, little
hungry one! It is a game played on a board
like checkers. This town is the only one in
the world where children learn chess in
school."</p>

<p>"In school?" asked Fritz.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Toymaker. "During certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
months each child goes to school with
his chessboard. Children learn the old game
just as you learn arithmetic."</p>

<p>"I think I would like that better than
arithmetic," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"But it is a difficult game," said Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>They made their camp near the peaceful
town of Str&ouml;beck. They noticed some peasant
girls tending geese in a field.</p>

<p>"See, Mother," said Mitzi. "They play
chess while they watch the geese."</p>

<p>"During the World War," said Mrs. Toymaker,
"the Str&ouml;beck money was printed
with colored chessboards and chessmen
upon it."</p>

<p>Later, the family made their way to the
public square. The children enjoyed the parade
of strangely dressed people. There
were kings, queens, bishops and knights
marching along. They represented the
chessmen with which the game is played.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
The whole town was in a very gay mood.</p>

  <div align="right">

   border="0" alt="MITZ LOOKED CROOKED"></img></span>
  </div>

<p>Mr. Toymaker sold enough toys to cheer
him somewhat. After supper they sat outside
their wagon, and Mrs. Toymaker told
them all she knew about this strange place.</p>

<p>"Chess is an ancient game," she said.
"Str&ouml;beck has been playing it for many
years. Children begin
to learn it when
they are still babies.
There once lived a
boy of seven who became
a champion.
He even beat the village
schoolmaster."</p>

<p>Fritz liked to hear
these stories. He listened
eagerly. But
Mitz had only one
thought these days. That thought was the
costume for Fritz.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>

<p>She had her eye upon the yellow curtains
of the wagon. How fine they would be for
her purpose! The family traveled further,
and all the time Mitzi sewed. Slowly the costume
grew, but too slowly for Mitzi.</p>

<p>One day when Mrs. Toymaker returned
from the market place, she thought surely
her eyes were playing her tricks. The windows
of their wagon looked crooked. Then
out came Mitzi. And what had happened to
Mitzi? She looked crooked, too!</p>

<p>"Mitz, what have you done to the curtains?"
asked Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>Before Mitzi could reply, Mrs. Toymaker
understood why Mitzi looked crooked. Her
little red skirt was hanging in a strange, uneven
way. Mrs. Toymaker inspected the
curtains.</p>

<p>"Mitzi!" she said sternly. "You have cut
pieces off the top of the curtains and tried
to sew them together again."</p>

<p>Mitzi said nothing, but her face was
flushed.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

<p>"Oh, Mitz!" continued Mrs. Toymaker.
"You have cut pieces off your red skirt and
tried to sew it together, too. Now it is hanging
all wrong. You naughty little girl!"</p>

<p>Fritz was out gathering wood for the fire.
Mitzi had worked alone and quickly.</p>

<p>"I do not know what you are up to, Mitzi,"
said her mother. "But you must be punished
for this."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

<p>So for three days Mitzi was made to stay
in the wagon alone. She could not go with
the family to market. She had to eat her
meals alone. She had to eat black bread and
drink water like a prisoner. This was very
hard for sausage-loving Mitz. She was in
disgrace.</p>

<p>However, she bore her punishment like a
man. She knew that she had done wrong.
She helped her mother to arrange the curtains
and to fix her skirt. She said nothing.
But all the time she knew that soon the
brightly colored little cloak would be
finished.</p>

said Mitzi.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the steps of their
wagon, sewing. Fritz sat beside her. He
held an open book in his hands.</p>

<p>The Toymakers had made their camp outside
of Eisenach (&#298;´z&#277;n-&auml;k). Mr. and Mrs.
Toymaker had gone to town, leaving Mitz
and Fritz with the wagon. Mitzi wanted to
finish that costume before they arrived in
Leipzig. Fritz was reading about Johann
Sebastian Bach (B&auml;k), who was born in
Eisenach.</p>

<p>"Bach came from a family of musicians,"
read Fritz. "The name 'Bach' means 'brook.'
Beethoven once said, 'He is not a brook but
an ocean!'"</p>

<p>"No," said Fritz, as he tried it on. "It fits
me perfectly. How pretty it is, and how
clever is my Mitz!"</p>

<p>Mitzi waggled her head proudly.</p>

<p>She said, "Many people will be in Leipzig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for the fair. When you give your concert,
I'll fetch Father and bring him to where you
are playing. Oh, how surprised and pleased
he'll be!"</p>

<p>Fritz smiled. Then he went on reading
from his book while Mitzi sewed.</p>

<p>"'When Bach was a boy,'" read Fritz,
"'his father died and he lived with his
brother Christoph. One day Christoph
brought home a book full of beautiful music.
The little boy longed to play it. But Christoph
was jealous of Sebastian's talent. He
refused to let him have the music book and
locked it up.</p>

<p>"'Poor Sebastian wanted very much to
play that music. So every night he got up
and stole downstairs into the music room.
He pulled the book out from between the
bars of the bookcase. He sat in the light
of the moon and copied the notes.</p>

<p>"'At last, after many weeks, he had
copied the whole volume. He went to sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with his work under his pillow. He was
very happy. But next day a terrible thing
occurred. While Sebastian was playing the
music on the harpsichord, his brother Christoph
came in. When Christoph saw what the
boy had done, he took away Sebastian's
precious copy book.'"</p>

<p>She was interested in this poor little fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
who had longed so much for music. She
was very angry with the brother.</p>

<p>Fritz read on: "'Sebastian fell ill. He
was so unhappy that he could not eat. Then,
one day he discovered that he could play the
beautiful music without notes. It was all
written in his heart!'"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mitzi. "That is good!"</p>

<p>"'But just as he was playing it,'" continued
Fritz, "'in came his brother Christoph
again&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"The goose!" sniffed Mitzi.</p>

<p>"'Christoph stood in the doorway listening,'"
read Fritz. "'At first he was ready
to stop the playing. But at last it dawned
upon him that his little brother was truly a
great artist.'"</p>

<p>"So he stopped being jealous?" asked
Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fritz. He closed the book and
sighed, adding, "It must have been terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
for Sebastian when his brother took away
the music he loved."</p>

<p>Mitzi sighed, too. Then she jumped up

us go and get some cheese!"</p>

<h3>A CASTLE AND THE POET CITY</h3>


<p>As the Toymaker family drove away from
Eisenach, they passed below the Wartburg (V&auml;rt´bo&#861;ork)
Castle. Mrs. Toymaker asked
her husband to stop. She wanted the children
to see this historic place. The castle
stands high on a crag.</p>

<p>As they walked toward it, Mrs. Toymaker
said, "It was here that Martin Luther translated
the Bible from Latin into German so
the German people could read it. There is
a tale of how the Devil appeared before
Luther, who threw an inkwell at the Devil's
head. The spot where that inkwell hit the
wall is still to be seen in the castle."</p>

<p>"Please tell us another story about the
castle," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"St. Elizabeth was Countess of Wartburg,"
said Mrs. Toymaker. "She had a
heartless husband, who did not want her to
be kind to the poor and sick. Upon one occasion
he met her going out of the castle
carrying a basket.</p>

<p>"'Where are you going? And what have
you in that basket?' he asked.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

<p>"Now, Elizabeth had loaves of bread in the
basket. She was taking them to a poor old
woman. But she was afraid of her husband's
wrath.</p>

<p>"So she answered, 'I have only roses in
the basket.'</p>

<p>"The Count, her husband, looked into the
basket to be sure. And, behold, the
Countess had spoken truthfully. The loaves
of bread had been turned into roses!"</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Toymaker and the children gone
into the castle, they would have seen pictures
of this story drawn upon the walls. But
they did not go inside. They went back to
their wagon and proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>"I hope that my friend, Mr. Krauss, will
be in Leipzig," said Mr. Toymaker. "Mr.
Krauss is a bookseller. He will surely help
me. He may even start a toy shop for me
in Leipzig. I hope I shall find Mr. Krauss!"</p>

<p>However, before they reached Leipzig,
they stopped in Weimar (V&#299;´m&auml;r), the "poet city."</p>

<p>Weimar is where Goethe (G&#535;´t&#7869;),
Germany's greatest poet, once lived. School
children were taught to salute the poet
Goethe, when they passed him on the street.
Today children are still taken to Weimar by
their teachers and told about Goethe's life.</p>

<p>Long ago, a little boy was brought to Weimar
to visit at the old poet's home. This little
boy was about the same age as Fritz and
also loved music. Felix Mendelssohn
(M&#277;n´d&#277;l-s&#333;n) was his name. Goethe met
young Mendelssohn in the garden and led
him into the house and to the piano.</p>

<p>He said, "Now, make a little noise for me."</p>

<p>Felix played so beautifully that Goethe
said, "You have given me great pleasure.
What would you like me to do for you?"</p>

<p>Felix answered, "I should like you to
kiss me."</p>

<p>Mitz and Fritz had heard many stories
about Felix Mendelssohn. He was their
mother's favorite composer.</p>

<p>She had told them how this wonderful boy had written
music when he was only a baby. She had
told them about the way Felix used to lead
a big orchestra. He had been so small that
he had had to stand upon a chair.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Toymaker did not know that her
own little boy had a gift, too. Sometimes
she wondered, of course. Still she agreed
with Mr. Toymaker that very few people are
born with genius. Only naughty little Mitz
was sure because she loved Fritz so much.
She loved him and made up her mind that
everyone in the world was going to find out
about his beautiful music.</p>

<p>As they left Weimar, Mitzi squeezed her
brother's hand.</p>

<p>"We are on our way to Leipzig now," she
said.</p>

once did he think of a concert that was to
be given for him.</p>

<h3>THE LEIPZIG FAIR</h3>


<p>One of the great fairs of the year was now
going on in Leipzig. The Toymakers drove
by the railway station, the largest in Europe.
Many people were hurrying in and out.
They passed the church where Johann
Sebastian Bach used to sing.</p>

<p>All manner of peddlers swarmed the
streets. The children opened their eyes
wide at sight of one man entirely covered by
clocks. He was a clock peddler from the
Black Forest. Traders from all over the
country were in Leipzig with their wares.
Buyers from every place were at the fair
to buy.</p>

<p>"See, children," said Mrs. Toymaker.
"There is a statue of Mendelssohn, the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
boy who used to lead an orchestra. When
he grew up, he led his orchestra in that
building."</p>

<p>Leipzig is a city of books. Everyone seems
to be reading. They read even as they stroll
along the streets.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker immediately set out to find
his friend, Mr. Krauss, the bookseller. But
he could not find his friend.</p>

<p>The first day at the market place was very
dismal. Nobody paid any attention to Mr.
Toymaker's wares. There were too many
beautiful toys to be seen.</p>

<p>"It is the same here as it was in Nuremberg,"
said Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>Her sweet face was sad. "Oh, what are
we to do?" the poor lady was thinking.</p>

<p>But Mitzi knew what to do. Tomorrow
she and Fritz intended to slip away from
their booth in the market place. Today
their father needed them there to help.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker had displayed his prettiest
toys: brightly colored soldiers, flaxen-haired
dolls, and animals with big, staring-eyes.
Yet even children did not stop. At a shop
across the square were dolls that talked and
walked, engines that sped along tracks, airplanes
that flew, and doll houses with electric
lights in them and elevators and running
water. Is it any wonder that Mr. Toymaker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
carved toys did not attract people?</p>

<p>"Run back to the wagon and make some
coffee," said Mrs. Toymaker to Mitz and
Fritz. "Father and I will stay here a little
longer. When we get home we shall have
supper."</p>

<p>"But there is nothing to eat in the wagon,"
said Mitzi.</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker looked at her husband.
Mr. Toymaker turned to Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Obey your mother," he said. "Go home
and make coffee. When we come, we shall
bring food with us."</p>

<p>Mitz and Fritz and Frank went slowly
back to the wagon.</p>

<p>"I do not understand how Father can
bring food," said Mitzi. "There is certainly
no money with which to buy it."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow there will be money," smiled
Fritz.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mitzi. "Because of your
concert. And Father must be there to see."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Suddenly she cried, "Oh, careful, you
donkey! You are splashing in mud puddles.
You are getting your feet all wet!"</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="400">

  </table>

<p>But Fritz did not care. He was dreaming.
He liked mud puddles because he was a boy.
He liked dreams because he was an artist.</p>

<p>When they reached their wagon home,
Mitzi put the coffee on the stove. Soon Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and Mrs. Toymaker arrived. Their arms
were full of bundles.</p>

<p>"See what a nice supper we are to have,"
said Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>She was smiling, but Mitzi noticed that
there were tears in her blue eyes. Mitzi noticed
something else besides the tears.</p>

<p>"Mother!" she cried. "Where is your
pretty blue necklace?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker had always worn a string
of sparkling blue beads. They were quite
valuable and were her only piece of jewelry.
She had loved them because Mr. Toymaker
had given them to her before Mitz and Fritz
were born.</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker did not answer Mitzi. She
began to untie the bundles.</p>

<p>"See," she said. "Black bread and milk!"</p>

<p>"But, Mother," insisted Mitzi, "where is
your necklace? Have you lost it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker saw the terror in Mitzi's
eyes. That necklace had seemed to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
girl the finest and prettiest in all the world.
Her mother was not her mother without it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker did not know what to say.
She drew Mitzi close and kissed her.</p>

<p>But Mr. Toymaker said, "Enough of this,
Mitzi. Go and help prepare the supper.
You are too curious!"</p>

<p>"But, Father&mdash;" began Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Mr. Toymaker. "I
shall tell you. We sold the necklace so that
we could buy food. Now, are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker's voice sounded cross. But
his face looked very worried.</p>

<p>"Oh, the beautiful necklace!" cried Mitzi.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker untied a package.</p>

<p>"Oh, the beautiful cheese!" he sniffed.</p>

<p>He was trying to make the best of things.
He was trying to be jolly&mdash;poor Mr. Toymaker!</p>

<p>"One cannot grieve about neck decorations,"
he said, "when the stomach cries out
to be decorated!"</p>

<h3>THE CONCERT</h3>


<p>Mitzi decided to hold the concert in a park.
The market square was too noisy and bustling.
She wanted her brother's beautiful
music to have a beautiful setting. The two
children walked through Mendelssohn
Street, Bach Street, Beethoven Street, and
Mozart (M&#333;´tz&auml;rt) Street.</p>

<p>"Leipzig is a wonderful city," thought
Fritz. "They have named their streets after
their musicians."</p>

<p>What would Father think of that? There
was no street named after a toy maker!</p>

<p>Bismarck Street was named for a great
German leader. The strength and wisdom
of Prince Otto von Bismarck helped Germany
to become a powerful nation.</p>

<p>In the park many people strolled to and
fro. Some were reading. The children came
upon a silver pond with beautiful shady
trees all about it.</p>

<p>"Now, Fritz," said Mitzi, "you must stand
here beside the pond. See how peaceful it
is. Your music will float across the water.
It will sound like music from heaven."</p>

<p>Fritz put on the homemade Pied Piper
cloak. Then he stood beside the pond and
began to play. Several people stopped,
among them a group of students with books
under their arms.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

<p>"Is the young musician your brother?"
asked one student of Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mitzi. "And I am his
sister."</p>

<p>The youths laughed and gave her a coin.</p>

<p>"Play some Mendelssohn, young one,"
they said to Fritz.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

<p>The boy obligingly played what they requested.
The audience grew. Some threw
coins and asked Fritz to play certain tunes.
He could play nearly everything they called
for. Mrs. Toymaker had been a good
teacher. Besides, Fritz could play anything
after he had heard it once.</p>

<p>Mitzi was very happy. She beamed at the
crowd of listeners.</p>

<p>"Now," she thought, "is the time to fetch
Father." She whispered to Fritz, "I am going
for Father. I shall be back presently.
Play until I come."</p>

<p>As Mitzi turned to leave, she bumped into
a gentleman who carried a violin case under
his arm. Mitzi did not know that this gentleman
was an important music master. She
hardly looked at him.</p>

<p>She said quickly, "Excuse me, please," and
pushed her way out of the crowd. She must
go for her father.</p>

<p>The music master stood quite still, listening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
What was that he heard? What did
he see? A little boy standing beside a pond,
playing the violin&mdash;a little boy with a smiling
face, playing the violin better than any
of the music master's grown-up pupils.
Who was this little boy? Where had he
learned to play like that?</p>

<p>The music master drew closer to Fritz.
He asked Fritz to play compositions by Bach
and Mozart. He was astonished at how well
Fritz played them.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mitzi hurried to her
father's booth in the square.</p>

<p>"Father," she cried, "come! Come
quickly! I have something to show you."</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker jumped as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by startling me like
that?" he said to Mitzi. "You are like a
young thunderbolt!"</p>

<p>Mitzi's cheeks were glowing. Her eyes
danced.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

<p>"Fritz is playing&mdash;" she began eagerly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Toymaker cut her short. He was
in a bad mood. He had sold no toys again
today and he could not find his friend, Mr.
Krauss. He was jealous, too, of the toyshop
keepers who were selling their handsome
wares. Now he spent his rage upon
little Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried. "Do not speak again of
that boy's silly playing! Go and bring him
to me now. You and he shall keep my booth
for me. I am going once more to look for
Mr. Krauss."</p>

<p>Mitzi's glowing cheeks turned pale. She
pulled at her father's sleeve.</p>

<p>"No, no! You must come with me," she
pleaded. "Please, Father, close up the booth
just for a little while, until we return, and
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried Mr. Toymaker. "Do you
tell me what to do or do I tell you what to
do? Now, go and fetch that lazy brother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
yours. Bring him back here to help you
keep my booth for me."</p>

<p>When poor, weeping Mitzi returned to the
park, the gentleman with the violin case was
still there. He stood very close to Fritz.
The boy was playing a minuet. A rather
large crowd still remained. Mitzi waited until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Fritz finished playing the minuet. Then
she went up to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fritz," she said, "Father would not
come with me. He wants us to go to the
market place right away."</p>

<p>Fritz let his violin fall to his side. A look
of disappointment passed over his face and
covered the smile.</p>

<p>"Do not leave yet," said a voice. "Play
some more."</p>

<p>It was the music master speaking. Mitzi
wiped a tear with the corner of her apron
and looked at the gentleman with the violin
case. His expression was kind.</p>

<p>"We must go," she said to him. "But we
shall be back again tomorrow."</p>

<p>Mitzi did not know just why she said that.
Only quite suddenly she had determined that
she would be back tomorrow.</p>

<p>Some one in the crowd called, "One more
selection! Come, young one; play!"</p>

<p>A coin came tumbling at Fritz's feet.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

<p>"Yes, yes! More music, little fiddler!
More music!" cried others.</p>

  <div align="right">
   <span style="font-size:.7em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STOOD ON HER HEAD&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

   border="0" alt="STOOD ON HER HEAD"></img></span>
  </div>

<p>Mitzi sniffed to drive away her tears.
Then she
jumped upon a
bench. From
there she could
look down upon
the people. And
Mitzi Toymaker
began to make
a speech!</p>

<p>"Ladies and
gentlemen,"
she began.</p>

<p>Fritz thought
his sister looked
like a little
leader. Her
head was thrown back. Her two plump legs
were wide apart. Her arms were folded.
Fritz had to smile.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

<p>"I am glad, ladies and gentlemen," Mitzi
said, "that you liked my brother's playing.
Come back again tomorrow afternoon, and
Fritz will give another concert!"</p>

<p>The people clapped their hands and
shouted, "Hoch (h&#333;k´)!" which is like
"Hurrah."</p>

<p>Then some one called out, "What can <i>you</i>
do, little girl?"</p>

<p>Mitzi gave the speaker a quick glance.</p>

<p>"I can do this," she said; whereupon she
stood on her head.</p>

<p>There was a loud laugh from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, then!" cried several people.</p>

<p>The crowd began to move away. But the
music master hesitated. Should he say
something? No, he would return tomorrow.
He turned his steps in the direction of home.
But he could not forget the wonderful playing
he had just heard. Perhaps, after hearing
the little musician again tomorrow, he
would try to help the youngster.</p>

<h3>FRITZ AND HIS VIOLIN</h3>


<p>Sadly the brother and sister set off for the
market square.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Fritz," said Mitzi. "We will
go back to the park tomorrow. The people
liked your music. They will come again, and
perhaps Father will come and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mitzi broke off suddenly. She stopped in
the middle of the street with her mouth open.</p>

<p>"Fritz! Fritz!" she cried. "Oh, Fritzie!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What is it?" asked
Fritz, puzzled.</p>

<p>He could see nothing to disturb his sister
like this. He had not been walking in mud
puddles.</p>

<p>"I have thought of the very thing!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the girl. "I know just what we shall do. Oh,
why didn't I think of it before?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked her brother.</p>

<p>They began to walk on again, but Mitzi
was still in a state of excitement. She
clutched Fritz's arm and started to talk.
Her words tumbled over on top of one another,
they were in such a hurry to come out.</p>

<p>"You shall be a real Pied Piper, Fritz!"
she chattered. "Tomorrow I'll make another
speech in the park. I'll ask the people
to follow you just as the children followed
the Pied Piper. While you are playing you
will walk away. You'll be like the Piper leading
the rats and the children. Only, instead
of leading them to a cave, you'll lead them
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Fritz, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"To Father!" said Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitz!" cried Fritz, horrified.</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" said the girl. "You'll do as I
say. What fun! I know the people will follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
They are such jolly people! And what
a splendid way to show Father!"</p>

<p>The sadness had left Mitzi. She beamed.
She skipped along and sang, until Fritz
caught some of her joy.</p>

<p>They arrived at their father's booth. But
the toy maker was not there. He had closed
his stand. So the children went home to
their wagon. They found their father
awaiting them there. The toy maker was
twirling his mustache. He had a strange
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Now, Father," said Mitzi, "you can go
and look for Mr. Krauss. Fritz and I will
watch the booth for you."</p>

<p>But Mr. Toymaker did not move. Instead
he smiled in a way which left his eyes unsmiling.</p>

<p>"I have decided not to go," he said. "I
have decided to do something else."</p>

<p>"What, Father?" asked Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Tonight," said Mr. Toymaker, "we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have sausage and sauerkraut and other good
things for supper." Then he turned to Fritz,
saying, "Give me the violin."</p>

<p>The boy drew away his precious violin.
Mitzi stood in front of her brother.</p>

<p>"Father," she asked, "why do you want
Fritz's violin?"</p>

<p>"Because I am going to sell it," said Mr.
Toymaker. "It is a fine violin. It will bring
much money. Besides, it is quite useless to
me. Give it here."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

<p>But neither child moved. Mitz and Fritz
stood like two little statues.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" cried Mr. Toymaker.
"I want the violin. Give it to me."</p>

<p>Still they did not move. They stood looking
up at the toy maker like gingerbread
children out of "Hansel and Gretel."</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker reached out his hand to
take the violin from Fritz. But the boy put
it behind his back.</p>

<p>"Please, please," he said, "don't take it
away from me, Father!"</p>

<p>Now Mr. Toymaker really did not want to
hurt Fritz any more than he could help. He
loved this little fellow, even if he did think
the boy to be only an idle, music-loving
scamp.</p>

<p>"Fritz," he said in a kinder tone, "you will
soon be a man. You must learn to bear disappointments.
Come, now! Give me the
violin like a good boy."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the toy maker took the violin
from his son's hands. Then he patted Fritz
on the head.</p>

<p>"You must learn to help others, Fritz," he
said. "You must, above all, help your
father."</p>

<p>Fritz longed to cry out and say, "But that
is just what I want to do, Father!"</p>

<p>Only he could not speak. His eyes were
full of tears, and when he brushed the tears
away, the toy maker was gone. So was the
boy's beloved violin!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>THE PIED PIPER</h3>


<p>The Toymaker family had sausage and
sauerkraut and other good things for supper.
They ate their supper beside a camp
fire near their wagon. That is, Mr. and Mrs.
Toymaker did. But Mitz and Fritz could not
eat. No, even Mitz could touch nothing&mdash;not
even sausage!</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker tried to comfort them, but
it was hopeless. Fritz stared at the ground,
and his heart ached. He thought he should
never again play his violin. Mitzi sat with
Frank's long nose on her lap and stroked
the dog's floppy ears.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," thought Mitzi, "the crowd
will come to the park to hear Fritz play, and
there will be no Fritz!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

<p>Of course, Mitzi did not know that the music
master would come, too. The kind music
master would return. He would look for the
little boy whose music had pleased him so
much. He would wonder what had happened
to the clever youngster whom he
wanted to help. Mitzi did not know this. If
she had known it, she would have been more
unhappy than she already was.</p>

<p>The next morning passed much the same
as the day before. Mr. Toymaker sold
nothing at his booth in the market place.</p>

<p>At noon he said, "There is no use staying
here any longer."</p>

<p>He closed up his booth, and they went back
to the wagon. After lunch Mr. and Mrs.
Toymaker sat upon the steps of their wagon.
They talked and talked about what they were
to do.</p>

<p>"We could go to some small town and settle
down," said Mrs. Toymaker. "When winter
comes, a wandering life will not be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
pleasant. Mitz and Fritz should go to
school. This gypsy life is not the best life
for them."</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker said, "That is quite true.
Let us find a town where people are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
spoiled by fine toys. There we shall settle
and be content to live simply."</p>

<p>"I do wish&mdash;" began Mrs. Toymaker.</p>

<p>She had started to talk about Fritz. However,
she knew that it made Mr. Toymaker
angry. So she stopped.</p>

<p>They sat together for a long time. Mrs.
Toymaker knitted. Mr. Toymaker smoked
a pipe. Both were so full of serious thoughts
that they did not wonder about Mitz and
Fritz. They did not wonder why the children
had not been there since noon. As the shadows
grew longer and a little late breeze blew
up, Mrs. Toymaker arose.</p>

<p>"I must prepare supper," she said. "I
wonder where the children are."</p>

<p>She called, "Fritz! Mitz!" But there was
no answer.</p>

<p>"What is that I see in the distance?" asked
Mr. Toymaker.</p>

<p>He shaded his eyes with his hand. He
looked in the direction of the setting sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Mrs. Toymaker looked, too. Black forms
were coming toward them. A crowd of people
was drawing near, following some one
who made music.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Mrs. Toymaker. "The notes
of a violin!"</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker stood up. The music, sweet
and lively, came to them more clearly.
Slowly the forms of the people grew more
distinct as they drew closer.</p>

<p>"Why, it is a Pied Piper!" exclaimed Mrs.
Toymaker. "It must be the joke of some
children."</p>

<p>But all the time Mrs. Toymaker thought
she knew who it was. She thought she knew
that it was really&mdash;Yes, now there could
be no doubt about it!</p>

<p>"It is Fritz!" cried Mrs. Toymaker. "It is
our own little Fritz!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>THE MUSIC MASTER</h3>


<p>The strange procession stopped before
the wagon of the toy maker. The Pied Piper
continued his playing. The crowd stood listening.
When the piece was finished, they
clapped and threw coins and shouted,
"Hoch!"</p>

<p>Then a gentleman carrying a violin case
hoisted the Pied Piper upon his shoulder. He
walked over with the Pied Piper to where
the toy maker stood.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the violin-case gentleman, "I
believe this is your son."</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker was so amazed that he could
only nod his head.</p>

<p>The gentleman went on, "Your son's playing
has made us all very happy. We followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
his music just as the children of long
ago followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin."</p>

  <div align="right">
   <span style="font-size:.7em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"HERE IS YOUR SON!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
   <img style="float:right;" src="./images/illus147.jpg" width="300"
   border="0" alt="&quot;HERE IS YOUR SON!&quot;"></img></span>
  </div>

<p>The people began to laugh and cheer and
call for more
music.</p>

<p>But Mr. Violin-Case
said, "The
concert is over.
Now I am going
to see Mr. Toymaker
alone."</p>

<p>When the people
had left, Mr.
Violin-Case and
Mr. Toymaker
went into the
wagon together.
There they stayed for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Outside, Mrs. Toymaker drew her children
close to her.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said. "Do tell me all
about it."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>

<p>Mitzi said, "Good! I'll tell you, Mother.
But first I must have a pretzel to eat. I have
had nothing since morning."</p>

<p>Mitzi helped herself to a fistful of the salty,
twisted crackers. She began to eat and to
talk at the same time&mdash;a feat which cannot
be done very well.</p>

<p>Her words sounded to Mrs. Toymaker like
"Yummeemummee."</p>

<p>The mother laughed and said, "Fritz had
better tell me."</p>

<p>Fritz began, "Mitzi believed all along that
people would really like my music. She
wanted to show Father. So today we went
back to the same park where I played yesterday."</p>

<p>By this time, Mitzi had swallowed her first
pretzel, so she continued the story: "I stood
upon a bench. I talked very loudly so everyone
could hear. I said that our father had
sold Fritz's violin and that Fritz could not
play for them. I said I was sorry that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
could not keep our promise and give another
concert. Then the gennamemmaeppa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mitzi!" laughed Mrs. Toymaker. "How
can I understand you when you are eating
pretzels?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman stepped up to us," went
on Fritz.</p>

<p>"What gentlemen, dear?"</p>

<p>"The one who is in the wagon with
Father," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"He has a red face, and he stands like
this," said Mitzi.</p>

<p>She stuck out her stomach trying to imitate
the gentleman who was rather large.</p>

<p>"Shame, Mitzi!" said her mother. "Go on,
please, Fritz. Tell me the rest."</p>

<p>"The gentleman said he would help us,"
Fritz continued. "He took this beautiful
violin out of its case and gave it to me."
Tenderly Fritz laid the violin in his mother's
hands. "He told me to play it. I did, and
he seemed to like what I played."</p>

<p>"After the concert," interrupted Mitzi, "I
jumped up on the bench again. I asked the
people to follow Fritz just as if he were the
Pied Piper."</p>

<p>"At first," broke in Fritz, "they laughed
and didn't want to. But the gentleman
urged them to do it. He said it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
fun. He said he would like to see where I
would lead them."</p>

<p>"And this is where we led them," said
Mitzi.</p>

<p>"Now," said Fritz, "Father will know that
what we told him is true."</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker looked very happy. She
hugged Fritz to her. Just then Mr. Toymaker
came out of the wagon with the
violin-case gentleman.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Schmitt," said the toy maker
to his family. "Mr. Schmitt is a great music
master from Berlin."</p>

<p>Fritz's eyes began to pop. Mitzi sat down
with a jolt, her mouth open. Mrs. Toymaker
felt her heart beating very fast.</p>

<p>The music master went up to Fritz and
took his hand.</p>

<p>"I have just had a talk with your father,
Fritz," he said. "You are coming with me
to Berlin. You are all coming to live in the
big city of Berlin. And you, Fritz, will study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and in time will become a great musician."</p>

<p>Mr. Schmitt stayed to supper with the
family. He sat with them beside their gypsy
fire. He told them about Berlin and promised
to help Mr. Toymaker because of Fritz's
music.</p>

<p>He said to the toy maker, "Your little boy
has a gift from God. You must help him
make it a gift to the world."</p>

<p>As they sat about the fire after supper Mr.
Schmitt told them about another boy.</p>

<p>"Many years ago," he said, "there lived a
boy named George Handel (H&#259;n´del). He
was born in Halle (H&auml;l´&#7869;), a town not far
from here. Today there is a statue of George
Handel in the center of Halle. He became
a famous composer. But when he was your
age, Fritz, his father would not allow him to
play."</p>

<p>Fritz looked at his mother. Mitzi looked
at her father. The toy maker looked away
from them all.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>

<p>"You see," went on Mr. Schmitt,
"George's father was a good man. But he
did not love music. He wanted his son to be
a doctor. Now, one day little George played
for a powerful duke, who loved music. The
duke decided to help young George.</p>

<p>"He said to Mr. Handel, 'You are a good
man. But your son will be a great man. His
music will fill people's hearts with beauty.
Can you do that?'"</p>

<h3>BERLIN AND HAPPINESS</h3>


<p>The Toymakers and Mr. Schmitt flew to
Berlin in an airplane. People in Germany
travel by plane as easily as we travel by train
and boat. Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The Berlin airport is the largest in the world.</p>

<p>As the children stepped out of the plane
they heard music. They saw people sitting
about at tables eating and drinking. These
people were watching the landings of the
different airships.</p>

<p>"Come. We shall go to my home," said
Mr. Schmitt. "I have a large house near
the music school. I want you to stay there
with me until you find a home of your own."</p>

<p>They drove in a taxicab through the Brandenburg
Gate and into a famous street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Unter den Linden (&#332;&#333;n´t&#7869;r d&#277;n L&#301;n´d&#277;n).
New York has Fifth Avenue. London has
Piccadilly Circus. Chicago has Lake Shore
Drive. Edinburgh has Princes Street. And
Berlin has Unter den Linden.</p>

<p>Mr. Toymaker had sold his wagon. Mr.
Schmitt planned to find him work in a big
Berlin toy shop. Later, the kind music master
intended to find a cosy home for the
family. Mitz and Fritz were going to school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Fritz would study music and practice on his
violin. One day he would be able to give real
concerts.</p>

<p>Mr. Schmitt lived in an old-fashioned
house, which seemed beautiful to the children.
It was full of ornaments and heavy
furniture. Great pictures of musicians hung
upon the walls.</p>

<p>Mitz, Fritz, and their dog immediately explored
the house from attic to cellar. In the
kitchen, Mitzi found a jolly cook, who gave
her cookies. Yes, Mitzi knew that she was
going to like Berlin!</p>

<p>Fritz found musical instruments in every
room. Sounds of piano and violin and flute
came from all quarters of the house. No,
never before in all his life had Fritz been
so happy!</p>

<p>That evening, when the children were in
bed, Mr. and Mrs. Toymaker sat talking.</p>

<p>"It is true," said Mr. Toymaker to his wife.
"You were right. Fritz has turned beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
into gold. People will pay for things even
if they cannot touch them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Toymaker replied, "But even if they
cannot touch music, music can touch them."</p>

<p>At last Mr. Toymaker agreed.</p>

<p>"It can touch their hearts," he said.</p>
